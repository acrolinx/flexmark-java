 * Base interface for a parser/renderer extension.

 * This base interface is for convenience, so that a list of extensions can be built and then used
 * for configuring both the parser and renderer in the same way.
 *
 * <p>Bor convenience and by convention, classes that implement this method also have a static
 * create() method that returns an instance of the extension.
